Let's move forward with the second practical lesson in your GitHub Actions learning path: **Automating Unit Tests with GitHub Actions**.

### Objective
Learn how to create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs your unit tests every time you push changes to your repository.

### Prerequisites
- Completion of the first lesson on GitHub Actions.
- A GitHub repository with a simple application that has unit tests set up.
- Basic understanding of unit testing and the testing framework used in your project (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python).

### Lesson 2: Automating Unit Tests

**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Automated Testing with GitHub Actions**

- Automated testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that changes don't break existing functionality. GitHub Actions can run your test suite on every push or pull request, providing immediate feedback on your changes.

**Step 2: Prepare Your Application**

- Ensure your application has unit tests written and that they can be run locally without errors. For this example, let's assume you're using a Node.js application with tests written using Jest.

**Step 3: Create a Workflow for Automated Testing**

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. If you're following from the previous lesson, you already have this directory set up.
2. Create a new file named `run-tests.yml`.
3. Add the following content to your `run-tests.yml` file, adjusting the steps as necessary for your project's testing framework:

```yaml
name: Run Unit Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```

- This workflow is triggered on every push and pull request to the repository. It sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs the tests using `npm test`.

**Step 4: Commit and Push Your Workflow**

- Commit your `run-tests.yml` workflow file and push it to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/run-tests.yml
git commit -m "Add automated tests workflow"
git push origin main
```

**Step 5: Verify Your Workflow**

- After pushing your changes, go to the GitHub repository's Actions tab to see the workflow execution.
- GitHub Actions will execute the unit tests as defined in your workflow. You can click on the workflow run to see details and logs, including the output of the test runner.

### Conclusion

You've successfully automated the execution of unit tests using GitHub Actions. This ensures that tests are consistently run, helping to identify and rectify issues early in the development process. Automated testing workflows can be customized further to suit various testing environments, include different types of tests (e.g., integration tests), and even deploy your application if all tests pass.

In the next lesson, you could explore more advanced topics, such as deploying your application to a hosting platform, setting up workflows for different branches, or incorporating security and code quality checks into your CI/CD pipeline.
